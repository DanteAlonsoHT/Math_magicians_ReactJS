# Math Magicians | Components.

For this repository, I've created a project to create a React component, the main objective is to learn the way to create React apps using the official documentation, learning how to set up linters for React projects, and learning how to create and manage React components properly.

## Built With üî®

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- React JS
- Visual Studio Code
- Git & Github

### Install

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
- Open terminal
- Clone this project by the command: 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/DanteAlonsoHT/Math_magicians_ReactJS.git
```

- Then go to the main folder using the next command:

```
$ cd Math_magicians_ReactJS
```

- Finally, run the next command in the terminal to see the web app in your local browser, or also, you can use Live Server in Visual Studio Code.

```
$ npm start
```

### Prerequisites

- IDE to edit and run the code (We use Visual Studio Code üî•).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) already downloaded.


### Usage

- For anyone who wants to practice React skills.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
